Occupancy 
==========================

Occupancy class is an important parameter for natural hazard risk analysis of a building.
The occupancy model in the current version of BRAILS is trained on a dataset consists of residential buildings 
that are classified into three categories: single-family buildings (RES1), 
multi-family buildings (RES3) and commercial buildings (COM). Data of other occupancy classes are being collected and will be added to the new versions of BRAILS. 


Examples of different occupancy type is shown in :numref:`occupancyexample`.
