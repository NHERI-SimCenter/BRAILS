|app| (|full tool name|) provides a set of Python modules that utilize deep learning (DL), and computer vision (CV) techniques to extract information from satellite and street level images. The |app| framework also provides turn-key applications allowing users to put individual modules together to determine multiple attributes in a single pass or train general-purpose image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation models.

This document covers the features and capabilities of Version 3.0 of the tool. Users are encouraged to comment on what additional features and capabilities they would like to see in future versions of the application through the |messageBoard|.
